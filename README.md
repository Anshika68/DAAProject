Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) Problem
In graph theory, a dominating set for a graph G = (V, E) is a subset D of V such
that every vertex not in D is adjacent to at least one member of D. The
domination number Î³(G) is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set
for G.
A minimal dominating set is a dominating set in a graph that is not a proper
subset of any other dominating set. Every minimum dominating set is a minimal
dominating set, but the converse does not necessarily hold. Minimal dominating
sets can be used to compute the domatic number of a graph.
A minimum connected dominating set of a graph G is a connected dominating
set with the smallest possible cardinality among all connected dominating sets of
G. The connected domination number of G is the number of vertices in the
minimum connected dominating set.
